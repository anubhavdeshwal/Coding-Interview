1. Defination- A graph is a set of vertices and collection of edges where each edge connect two vertices with each other( a pair of vertices) .

2. Anomalies

	2.1 If Self Loop and parallel edges are present in graph : Multigraph

	2.2 If no such things are present : Simple graph

3. Grossary

	3.1 The vertices that are connected through an edge are called adjacent vertices

	3.2 An edge is incident to both vertices

	3.3 The total number of incident edges on an vertex defines it's degree

	3.4 A subgraph is a subset of edges and associated vertices that constitute that graph

	3.5 If a graph doesn't contains a cycle that it is called a forest and if it is also connected than it is called a tree
